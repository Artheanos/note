# note
Backend server written in Go

This web app doesn't do much, it just lets you login (kind of) and save a note to a database.
However, it was fun as I'm fairly new to Go and this app was made using only the basic http handlers. Things like session, cors headers were up to me to take care of ðŸ˜ƒ.
